# BAVT - `3dlidar.py` Documentation

### **Usage of this document** ( This Documentation is primarily focused on Linux )

##### Pre-Requisites:
We need **Python 3.8 to 3.10**. So please make sure you have that in your system. If you have the required python versions already, then the next sub-section can be skipped.

If you don't have python on your system, or have a different version, then please read the next Sub-section.


#### Python Installation (Recommend using python 3.10.11)
##### Mainly for Linux users: ( I am using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ) | Python.org 

1.  **Go to the official Python downloads page** for version 3.10.11: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)

2.  **Scroll down** to the **Files** section at the bottom of the page.

3.  **Choose the correct installer** for your operating system.

      * **Windows:** Look for "**Windows installer (64-bit)**".
      * **macOS:** Look for "**macOS 64-bit universal2 installer**".
      * **Linux:** It's best to use your distribution's package manager (like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`). For example, on Ubuntu, you might use `sudo apt install python3.10`.

4.  **Download and run the installer**, following the on-screen instructions. Be sure to check the box that says "**Add Python 3.10 to PATH**" during installation on Windows.

#### CARLA Simulator Installation (Version 0.9.15) 

1.  You **must** have CARLA 0.9.15 installed. Download it from the official releases page:
    [https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)
    Click on the appropriate download link under the `0.9.15` release section.

2. After downloading, you will typically get a ZIP or `tar.gz` file.
     * **Extract** this file to a comfortable location, such as your home directory on Linux or `C:\` drive on Windows.
     * **Rename** the extracted folder to `carla_0.9.15` for consistency.
