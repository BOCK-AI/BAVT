In this article, we will discuss the most common types of Lidar sensors and their applications.[https://globalgpssystems.com/lidar/explore-the-different-types-of-lidar-technology-from-mechanical-to-solid-state-lidar/]      
1: Mechanical Lidar. Mechanical Lidar is the oldest type of Lidar sensor and uses a spinning mirror to scan the environment. ... 
2: Solid-State Lidar. Solid-State Lidar is a newer type of Lidar sensor that uses a solid-state laser and a photodetector to measure distances. ... 
3: Flash Lidar. Flash Lidar is a type of Lidar sensor that uses a flash lamp to emit a large number of laser pulses at once.  ... 
4: Frequency-Modulated. (Continuous-Wave (FMCW) Lidar) Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) Lidar uses a continuous wave laser and a frequency modulator to measure distances. ... 
5: Single-Photon Lidar. Single-Photon Lidar is a type of Lidar sensor that uses a single photon detector to measure distances. ...
